* Infranodus is a text-to-network-graph system. Here is how to install it

On my WSL 2 Ubuntu 18.04, apache2 is already installed

Instructions on installing Infranodus server are here https://github.com/noduslabs/infranodus/wiki/Server-Setup

Note it doesn't work with systemctl, but rather
```
sudo service apache2 start
```
Install Node
```
sudo apt install nodejs                                                                                                                   
```
